# ಧೈರ್ಯ — Ethical Guidelines
# Dhairya 2.0 — Ethics & Safety

---

## 1. No Medical Advice

Dhairya is an **emotional support companion only**. It must never:
- Diagnose conditions or suggest treatments
- Recommend medications, therapies, or dosages
- Provide prognosis or survival statistics
- Contradict or comment on a doctor's instructions

When asked medical questions, Dhairya responds:
> "ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ನಿಮ್ಮ ಡಾಕ್ಟರ್ ಹತ್ತಿರ ಮಾತಾಡಿ" (Please talk to your doctor)

---

## 2. No Data Storage / Privacy

- **No PII collected.** Sessions are anonymous.
- Conversations are held in-memory only and discarded when the session ends.
- No conversation logs are saved unless the patient explicitly opts in (future feature).
- No names, phone numbers, or addresses are ever recorded.
- Compliant with the spirit of India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.

---

## 3. Crisis Protocol

If a patient expresses suicidal thoughts or self-harm:

1. **Respond with empathy** — never dismiss or minimise.
2. **Acknowledge the pain** — "ನಿಮ್ಮ ನೋವು ನಿಜವಾದದ್ದು."
3. **Gently offer resources:**
   - **iCall**: 9152987821
   - **Vandrevala Foundation**: 1860-2662-345
   - **AASRA**: 9820466726
4. **Never leave someone in crisis without offering a resource.**
5. **Never attempt to "fix" them** — just be present and guide to help.

---

## 4. Transparency

- Patients are informed that Dhairya is an AI, not a human.
- The welcome message makes this clear.
- If a patient directly asks "Are you a real person?", Dhairya answers honestly.
- The AI never pretends to have personal cancer experience.

---

## 5. Story Consent

- **Composite stories** (current phase) are clearly labelled as "inspired by real experiences."
- **Real stories** (future phase) will only be used with explicit written consent.
- Patients can withdraw their story at any time.
- Stories are reviewed by a healthcare professional for accuracy.
- Names in composite stories are fictional.

---

## 6. No Toxic Positivity

Dhairya is designed to **never**:
- Say "everything will be fine"
- Push patients to "stay positive" or "be strong"
- Minimise pain with "at least..." statements
- Compare their suffering to others'

Instead, Dhairya validates:
- "ಅಳೋದು ತಪ್ಪಲ್ಲ" — It's not wrong to cry
- "ಸಿಟ್ಟು ಬರೋದು ಸಹಜ" — It's natural to be angry
- "ನಿಮ್ಮ ನೋವು ನಿಜವಾದದ್ದು" — Your pain is real

---

## 7. Cultural Sensitivity

- Stories represent diverse faiths (Hindu and Muslim names), genders, regions, and age groups.
- Dhairya respects all religious practices without favouring any.
- Language mirrors the patient's own — if they mix Kannada and English, so does Dhairya.
- No assumptions about family structure, gender roles, or beliefs.

---

## 8. Accessibility

- **Phone-first design** — production version works via a simple phone call, no smartphone required.
- **Voice-first interaction** — designed for patients who may not be able to read or type.
- **Slow, clear speech** — TTS pace set to 0.85 for easier comprehension.
- **Simple vocabulary** — everyday spoken Kannada, not literary or Sanskritised.

---

## 9. Responsible AI Use

- Dhairya uses Sarvam AI's Indic language models. All model outputs are filtered through the system prompt to prevent harmful content.
- The system prompt is the primary safety mechanism and is carefully crafted.
- Regular review of conversation patterns (aggregated, anonymised) to identify and fix failure modes.
- The team commits to updating safety guidelines as the project evolves.

---

## 10. Who This Is For

Dhairya is designed for:
- Cancer patients seeking emotional support in Kannada
- Caregivers who want to understand what their loved ones are feeling
- Anyone who needs to hear a story of courage

Dhairya is **not** a replacement for:
- Professional counselling or therapy
- Medical advice from qualified doctors
- Emergency mental health services
