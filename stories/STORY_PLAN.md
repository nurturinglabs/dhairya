## Sourcing Strategy

### Phase 1: Composite Stories (Week 1-2)
Write 10 stories based on:
- Real patterns from published survivor interviews
- Common experiences shared in cancer support forums
- Medical literature on patient experiences in Karnataka
- YouTube interviews with Kannada cancer survivors

**Important:** These are INSPIRED BY real experiences, not claiming to be specific real people. We clearly label them as "inspired stories" in the app.

### Phase 2: Real Stories (Month 2-3)
Partner with:
- **Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bengaluru** — Largest cancer hospital in Karnataka
- **HCG Cancer Centre** — Has branches across Karnataka
- **Indian Cancer Society, Karnataka chapter**
- **V Care Foundation** — Works with cancer patients
- **CanSupport India** — Provides palliative care

Approach: "We are building a free Kannada voice app for cancer patients. Would any of your survivors be willing to share their story to give strength to others?"

### Phase 3: Patient-Contributed Stories (Ongoing)
Once the app is live, patients who recover can choose to record their own story through the app itself — completing the circle of giving back.

## Story Quality Checklist

Every story must:
- [ ] Feel like a real person talking (not written essay)
- [ ] Include the diagnosis shock moment
- [ ] Honestly acknowledge pain and fear (no toxic positivity)
- [ ] Have one specific, small, human turning point
- [ ] Validate what current patients are going through
- [ ] End with earned hope — not empty "everything will be fine"
- [ ] Close with a direct message to the listener
- [ ] Use everyday spoken Kannada (not literary/formal)
- [ ] Be 2-4 minutes when read aloud
- [ ] Make someone feel less alone
